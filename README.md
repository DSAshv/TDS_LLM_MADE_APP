## Overview

This tool was developed using ChatGPT to assist students in verifying whether their Business Data Management (BDM) project reports adhere to specified guidelines. By using this tool, students can cross-check their documents before submission, ensuring they meet the required standards and avoid any potential errors.

## Features

- **Automated Report Validation**: The tool checks the report for adherence to formatting and content rules.
- **Error Detection**: Identifies common mistakes such as incorrect formatting, missing sections, and grammatical issues like passive voice usage.
- **Key Word Analysis**: Provides insights into the key words used in the report and highlights their frequency.
- **User-Friendly Report**: Generates an HTML report summarizing errors and feedback on the document, allowing for easy review and correction.

## How It Works

1. Upload your BDM project report in Word format (.docx).
2. The tool will analyze the document, checking for compliance with the specified rules such as font, spacing, content structure, and more.
3. An HTML report is generated that highlights any errors found and provides an overview of the document's structure and key words.
