            <p><strong>Sentence:</strong> As an organic store, Siragugal Iyarkai Angadi deals with products that have a shorter shelf life. The absence of a Sale or Return (SOR) option adds to the uncertainty, making Mr. Saravanan hesitant to invest additional capital. This situation often leads to unplanned inventory management, causing out-of-stock situations when existing or potential new customers request products. Such instances can leave a negative impression on customers and may be contributing to the difficulty in attracting new customers.</p>

            <p><strong>Sentence:</strong> Currently, Siragugal Iyarkai Angadi does not maintain electronic records; all data is stored in bills and diaries. The first step is to extract and digitize this sales data. If the existing data is insufficient, new data should be collected each time a customer places an order. Additionally, detailed information regarding each product—such as shelf life, profit margin, and turnover rate—should be gathered. With this data, a stock plan can be developed that prioritizes high-margin products and minimizes losses. The goal is to create a dynamic inventory management system that allows the business to plan stock acquisitions more effectively before purchasing from wholesalers or producers.</p>

Despite these obstacles, the business has maintained a loyal customer base, largely built through word-of-mouth within the community.

            <p><strong>Sentence:</strong> As an organic store, Siragugal Iyarkai Angadi deals with products that have a shorter shelf life. The absence of a Sale or Return (SOR) option adds to the uncertainty, making Mr. Saravanan hesitant to invest additional capital. This situation often leads to unplanned inventory management, causing out-of-stock situations when existing or potential new customers request products. Such instances can leave a negative impression on customers and may be contributing to the difficulty in attracting new customers.</p>

Additionally, detailed information regarding each product—such as shelf life, profit margin, and turnover rate—should be gathered. With this data, a stock plan can be developed that prioritizes high-margin products and minimizes losses. The goal is to create a dynamic inventory management system that allows the business to plan stock acquisitions more effectively before purchasing from wholesalers or producers.</p>

Implementing cost-cutting measures should be followed by collecting and comparing data on costs before and after these changes to evaluate their effectiveness.
